# bamazon node app
## Full Stack Development Bootcamp - Node.js &amp; MySQL

The purpose of this homework assignment was to make a really bad version of amazon, that doesn't deliver items on time, and has a very limited inventory.  But that's ok, you get to be both the customer and the manager of this fine online store.

The app makes use of the following node.js packages:
* mysql - used to connect to our MySQL database that will house the store inventory.
* inquiere - used to provide the interface to our CLI application.
* dotenv - used to access environmental variables, which is what we use to store the MySQL credentials.
